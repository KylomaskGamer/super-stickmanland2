i tried

# how to play the thing

1. go get the entire code thing
2. extract
3. open the index html

4. if that didnt work try going to vs code and go live

in sketch.js theres also the create level function
```js
function createLevel(){
  //This can be edited!
  for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    CreateBlock(i,1,"grass")
  }
  for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    CreateBlock(i,2,"dirt")
  }

}
```
you can edit it
idk
its been like many years since i did this
theres spikes coins blocks DIRT and a badly coded fella without animation
